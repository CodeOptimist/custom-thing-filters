  [h1]Hello World![/h1]
  As a programmer who loves this game, I wanted to finally share the improvements and tweaks I've benefited from back to the community, just as so many other modders have improved my experience. I love the small modifications to vanilla that have a huge impact, and am proud to be in the company of others passionate about not necessarily new guns and mechanics and effects, but quality of life on the Rim.
